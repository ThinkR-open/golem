This Vignette discusses how you can extend `{golem}`. 

## Project Hooks

### What it is

The `create_golem()` function comes with a `project_hook` parameter, a function run just after the `{golem}` project creation. 
It can be used to modify the project structure automatically just after its creation. 

This allows to define custom behavior when creating `{golem}` based app, that can be used for:

+ Adding a different front-end template in `R/app_ui.R` 

+ Changing configuration options in `inst/golem-config.yml`

+ Copying external files in `inst/app/www`

+ Removing any file from the default template

+ etc.

### How it works 

The function is called __after__ the default project has been created, and is executed __in the directory of the created package__. 
Here is a rough step by step of what happens when a project is created with `{golem}`:

1. The package name is generated
1. The directory that will receive the package is created 
1. Default `{golem}` template is copied and pasted
1. R moves to the directory of the newly created project, and runs the `project_hook` function
1. R moves back to the previous directory, and removes comments if needed
1. Project is open 

### Defining your own `project_hook`

The best way to extend `{golem}` project hook functionality is by defining this `project_hook` function in an external package. 
This will allow this function to be used inside the `{golem}` creation RStudio project creation widget: 

![](rstudioprojecthook.png) 

> Note that inside this widget, the function should be explicitely namespaced (pkg::fun)

The `project_hook` function takes three mandatory parameters, which are passed from `create_golem`:

+ `path`: the full path of the directory
+ `package_name`: the name of the package
+ `...` : further arguments that can be passed via `create_golem`

These parameters might not be used inside your own hook, but __they need to be set in the hook function skeleton__, for compatibility reasons.

### Example

Here is an example of a function that can be used to remove the `dev/` folder:

```{r}
no_dev <- function(path, package_name, ...){
   fs::dir_delete("dev")
}
create_golem("ici", project_hook = no_dev)
```

This one will create a CSS: 

```{r}
new_css <- function(path, package_name, ...){
  
  css_path <- fs::path_abs("inst/app/www/custom.css")
  
  fs::file_create(css_path)
  
  write_there <- function(...){
    write(..., file = css_path, append = TRUE)
  }
  
  write_there("body {")
  write_there("    background-color:red;")
  write_there("}")
  
  cli::cat_bullet("CSS generated")
  
}

create_golem("ici", project_hook = new_css)
```

## Module templates

### What it is

Module templates are a way to define your own content for creating the module script in `R/`.
It allows to extend `{golem}` module template functionality by creating your own content inside the module file. 

### How it works 

The function is called after the file(s) creation. 
Here is a step by step of what happens when the `add_module` function is called: 

1. Name is created, and so is the `R/` directory if needed.
1. The fct_ and utils_ files are created if necessary
1. The path to the module is generated
1. If the file already exists, it opens the file
1. If the file doesn't exist, R creates it and the `module_template` function is called
1. File is generated, and potentially open

(Note that the `module_template` function is not called if the file already exists).

### Defining your own `module_template`

You can then define your own function inside your `{golem}` based application, but chances are you will be defining them into your own package. 

Module template functions will receive, by default, the following parameters from `add_modules()`. 

+ `name`: the name of the module
+ `path`: the path to the file in R/
+ `export`: a TRUE/FALSE set by the `export` param of `add_module()`
+ `...` further arguments

These parameters might not be used inside your own function, but __they need to be set in the function skeleton__, for compatibility reasons.

### Example

```{r}
my_tmpl <- function(name, path, export, ...){
   # Define a template that only write the name of the 
   # module in the file
   write(name, path)
}
golem::add_module(name = "custom", module_template = my_tmpl)

my_other_tmpl <- function(name, path, ...){
   # Copy and paste a file from somewhere else
   file.copy(..., path)
}
golem::add_module(name = "custom", module_template = my_other_tmpl)
```


## JS & CSS templates

### What it is

JavaScript and CSS template allow to use your own functions to add code when creating JavaScript files, JavaScript handlers and CSS files.
These templates work inside `add_js_file()`, `add_js_handler()` and `add_css_file()`.

### How it works 

The function is called after the file creation. 
Here is a step by step of what happens when these functions are called: 

1. Name is created
1. The path is generated
1. If the file already exists, it opens the file
1. If the file doesn't exist, R creates it and the `template` function is called
1. File is generated, and potentially open

(Note that the `template` function is not called if the file already exists).

### Defining your own `template`

You can then define your own function inside your `{golem}` based application, but chances are you will be defining them into your own package. 

File template functions will receive, by default, the following parameters from the `add_*()` function. 

+ `path`: the path to the file 
+ `...` further arguments

These parameters might not be used inside your own function, but __they need to be set in the function skeleton__, for compatibility reasons.

### Example

```{r}
my_tmpl <- function(path, ...){
   # Define a template that only write the name of the 
   # module in the file
  write_there <- function(...){
    write(..., file = path, append = TRUE)
  }
  
  write_there("body {")
  write_there("    background-color:red;")
  write_there("}")
}
golem::add_css_file(name = "custom", template = my_tmpl)
```
