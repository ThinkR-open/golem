## Installing {golem}

You can install the stable version of `{golem}` from CRAN:
``` {r}
install.packages("golem")
```

The development version of `{golem}` can be installed from GitHub using the `{remotes}` package:
```{r}
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem")
```

## Getting started

Note before using `{golem}`:

- A `{golem}` app is contained inside a package, so knowing how to build a package is highly recommended. On the plus side, everything you know about package development can be reused in `{golem}`.

- A `{golem}` app works better if you are working with `shiny modules`, so knowing how modules work is recommended, but not mandatory.

In the rest of the Vignettes, we'll assume you're working in RStudio.

### Create a package

Once the package is installed, you can got to _File > New Project..._ in RStudio, and choose _"Package for Shiny App Using golem"_ input:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("golemtemplate.png")
```

If you want to do it directly via the command line, use:

```{r}
golem::create_golem(path = "path/to/package")
```

```{r include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}
x <- fs::path(tempdir(), "golex")
try(fs::dir_delete(x), silent = TRUE)
golem::create_golem(path = x, package_name = "golex", open = FALSE)
```

This command allows you to create "illegally-named" package (for example, `1234`) by passing the `check_name` argument to `FALSE`. Note that this is not recommended and __should only be done if you know what you are doing__.

Once you've got that, a new RStudio project will be launched. Here is the structure of this project:

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
z <- capture.output(fs::dir_tree(x))
z <- z[-1]
w <- lapply(
  z,
  function(x) {
    cat(x, "\n")
  }
)
```


If you're already familiar with R packages, most of these files will seem very familiar to you. That's because a `{golem}` app IS a package.

+ `DESCRIPTION` & `NAMESPACE`: Package meta-data.

+ `R/app_config.R`: Used to read inside `{golem}` config file located at `inst/golem-config.yml`.

+ `R/app_server.R`, `R/app_ui.R`: Top level UI and server elements.

+ `R/run_app.R`: a function to configure and launch the application.

+ `dev/`: Scripts that will be used along the process of developing your app. You don't need to fill all the script before starting: use them as a notebook for keeping track of what you're doing all along the project life.

+ `inst/app/www`: Where you will add external dependencies in `www` (images, css, etc), notably added with the `golem` functions used to create external resources.

+ `man`: Package documentation, to be generated by R & `{roxygen2}`.

## `dev/01_start.R`

Once you've created your project, the first file that opens is `dev/01_start.R`. This file contains a series of commands that you'll have to run once, at the beginning of the project.

Note that you don't have to fill everything, even though it's strongly recommended.

### Fill the DESCRIPTION

First, fill the `DESCRIPTION` by adding information about the package that will contain your app. The first function, `fill_desc()`, can be used to fill your `DESCRIPTION` file:

```{r }
golem::fill_desc(
  pkg_name = "shinyexample", # The name of the golem package containing the app (typically lowercase, no underscore or periods)
  pkg_title = "PKG_TITLE", # What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case, No Period)
  pkg_description = "PKG_DESC.", # What the package does (one paragraph).
  authors = person(
    given = "AUTHOR_FIRST", # Your First Name
    family = "AUTHOR_LAST", # Your Last Name
    email = "AUTHOR@MAIL.COM", # Your email
    role = c("aut", "cre") # Your role (here author/creator)
    set_options = TRUE # Set the global golem options
    ),
  repo_url = NULL, # The URL of the GitHub repo (optional),
  pkg_version = "0.0.0.9000" # The version of the package containing the app
)
```

About [the DESCRIPTION file](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html).

Additionally, `fill_desc()` sets a series of recommended global options in
`golem-config.yml` that will be reused inside `{golem}`.

### Set common Files

If you want to use the MIT license, README, code of conduct, lifecycle badge, a news file, etc.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## See ?usethis for more information
usethis::use_mit_license("Golem User") # You can set another license here
usethis::use_readme_rmd(open = FALSE)
usethis::use_code_of_conduct()
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("Experimental")
usethis::use_news_md(open = FALSE)
```

See [`{usethis}`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) for more info about these functions.

### Init Tests

Create a template for tests:

```{r}
golem::use_recommended_tests()
```

About [tests in a package](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html).

### Use Recommended Packages

This will add `{shiny}`, `{DT}`, `{attempt}`, `{glue}`, `{htmltools}`, and 
`{golem}` as dependencies to your package:

```{r}
golem::use_recommended_deps()
```

### Add various tools

+ If you want to change the default favicon:
    ```{r}
    # Remove current favicon
    golem::remove_favicon()
    # Add a new one
    golem::use_favicon(path = "path/to/favicon")
    ```
Note that you can add an URL, and the favicon will be downloaded to the `inst/app/www` folder.

> **Note**: If you are deploying your app with [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/), your favicon should have the `.png` extension, otherwise it is not going to work.

+ Utils: these two functions add two files with additional helper functions for
your `{golem}` project. They can be used along the process of building your app:
    ```{r}
    golem::use_utils_ui(with_test = TRUE)
    golem::use_utils_server(with_test = TRUE)
    ```
For a detailed description of the generated functions see the respective files 
`R/golem_utils_server.R` and `R/golem_utils_ui.R` for which also default tests 
are added in `tests/testthat` (to suppress this set `with_test = FALSE` in the
above calls).

## Try the app

To launch the app run:

```{r}
golem::run_dev()
```


You're now set! You've successfully initiated the project and can go to `dev/02_dev.R`:

```{r}
rstudioapi::navigateToFile("dev/02_dev.R")
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
try(fs::dir_delete(x), silent = TRUE)
```
