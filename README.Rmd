`Golem` is an opinionated framework for building production-grade shiny applications. 
It is designed to help you build robust, maintainable shiny apps, with a consistent structure and workflow. 

This package helps you to:

- **Build** a shiny application with a solid foundation inside a package,
- **Develop** your application in a robust and scalable way,
- **Test** your application with a set of tools and best practices,
- **Deploy** your application in a production-ready environment.

## Installation

You can install the stable version from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("golem")
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Thinkr-open/golem) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem")
```

## Create a new application with `golem`

### With RStudio

If you are developping in RStudio, you can use the `golem` RStudio addin to create a new application.

Go to `File` > `New Project` > `New Directory` > Search for `Package for Shiny App using golem`:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/golemtemplate.png")
```

### With R

You can also create a new application with the following R code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
golem::create_golem("mygolemapp")
```

Run this code in your R console will create a new golem application in a folder called `mygolemapp` where you run the code.

A new Rstudio window will open with the new project.

## Launch your app

Once your project is created, you can run your app with the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
golem::run_dev()
```

Enjoy your new app!
