Production-grade `{shiny}` applications, from creation to deployment.

`{golem}` is an opinionated framework that sets the standard for building production-grade `{shiny}` applications. It provides a structured environment that enforces best practices, fosters maintainability, and ensures your applications are reliable, and ready for deployment in real-world environments.

With `{golem}`, developers can focus on creating high-quality, robust `{shiny}` apps with confidence, knowing that the framework guides them through every step of the development process.

## Installation

-   You can install the stable version from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("golem")
```

-   You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Thinkr-open/golem) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem") # Stable development version
# remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem@dev") # Bleeding edge development version
```

## Get Started

Create a new app with the project template from RStudio:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkR-open/golem/master/inst/img/golemtemplate.png")
```

Or use the `golem::create_golem()` function:

``` r
golem::create_golem("myapp")
```

See your app in action by running `golem::run_dev()` function.

Then, follow the scripts at:

- `dev/01_start.R` to configure your project at launch
- `dev/02_dev.R` for day to day development
- `dev/03_deploy.R` to build the deployment enabler for your app

## Resources

The `{golem}` package is part of the [`{golemverse}`](https://golemverse.org/), a series of tools for building production `{shiny}` apps.

A list of various `{golem}` related resources (tutorials, video, blog post,...) can be found [here](https://golemverse.org/resources/), along with blogposts, and links to other packages of the `golemverse`.

## Dev part

You're reading the doc about version: `r pkgload::pkg_version()`

This `README` has been compiled on the

```{r}
Sys.time()
```

Here are the test & coverage results:

```{r error = TRUE}
devtools::check(quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
unloadNamespace("golem")
```

```{r error = TRUE}
Sys.setenv("NOT_CRAN" = TRUE);covr::package_coverage()
```
