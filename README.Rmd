# {golem} <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkR-open/golem/master/inst/rstudio/templates/project/golem.png" align="right" width="120"/>

`{golem}` is an opinionated framework for building production-grade shiny applications.

## Installation

-   You can install the stable version from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("golem")
```

-   You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Thinkr-open/golem) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem") # very close to CRAN version
# remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/golem@dev") # if you like to play
```

## Resources

The `{golem}` package is part of the [`{golemverse}`](https://golemverse.org/), a series of tools for Shiny.
A list of various `{golem}` related resources (tutorials, video, blog post,...) can be found [here](https://golemverse.org/resources/).


## Launch the project

Create a new package with the project template:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkR-open/golem/master/inst/img/golemtemplate.png")
```

## Step by step guide

See full documentation in the `{pkgdown}` website:

[CRAN] <https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/>

[dev] <https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/dev/>

After project creation, you'll land on `dev/01_start.R`. There are also `dev/02_dev.R` and `dev/03_deploy.R`

These files are used to keep a track of all the steps you'll be following while building your app.

### Step 1 : Getting Started

### Step 2 : Day to Day Dev

Read [Day to Day Dev](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/articles/b_dev.html) Vignette for a detailed walkthrough.

### Step 3: deploy

Read [Deploying Apps with {golem}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/articles/c_deploy.html) Vignette for a detailed walkthrough.
